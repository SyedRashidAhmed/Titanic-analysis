# Titanic Dataset Analysis

## Project Description

The Titanic Dataset Analysis project utilizes Python's Pandas library to explore and analyze the famous Titanic dataset. The dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, including demographic details and survival outcomes.

### Analyses:

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - The code begins by loading the dataset (`titanic.csv`) using Pandas and printing the first few rows to understand its structure.

2. **Descriptive Statistics:**
   - Basic descriptive statistics are printed, including column names and data types.

3. **Missing Values Handling:**
   - Missing values are handled using forward fill (`fillna(method='ffill')`) for columns like 'Embarked' and 'Cabin'.

4. **Cross-Tabulations:**
   - Cross-tabulations are performed to explore relationships between various variables:
     - `pd.crosstab(df['Name'], df['SibSp'])`
     - `pd.crosstab(df['Sex'], df['Pclass'])`
     - `pd.crosstab([df['Embarked'], df["Survived"]], df['Sex'])`
     - `pd.crosstab([df['Embarked'], df["Survived"]], [df['Sex'], df['Pclass']])`
     - ... and more.

5. **Family Size Calculation:**
   - The code calculates the family size by adding 'SibSp' and 'Parch' columns and inserts it as a new column named 'family' in the DataFrame.

6. **Survival Analysis:**
   - Survival analysis is conducted, examining survival rates across different passenger demographics such as gender, age, and passenger class.

7. **Visualization (Not Included):**
   - While the code focuses on data manipulation and analysis, further visualization of the findings could enhance understanding. This could involve plotting survival rates by gender, age group, or passenger class using libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn.

### How to Use:

- Users can clone this repository, install the required dependencies, and run the Python script to reproduce the analyses.
- Results are printed to the console, providing insights into the relationships within the dataset.
- Users can further customize the code or extend the analyses based on their requirements.

### Dataset Information:

- The Titanic dataset contains 891 records of passengers aboard the Titanic, with various attributes such as name, age, gender, ticket class, cabin number, port of embarkation, and survival status.

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Titanic dataset, uncovering insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival during the tragic event.
